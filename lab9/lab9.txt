QUESTION 1.  Read through the program lab9.bin. What do you expect the program to do? More specifically, which register will the program modify when it is run, and what will it contain when the program finishes? (You can probably figure this out merely by reading the comments provided in lab9.bin.)

ANSWER: The program clears the value in register R2, adds the value 12 decimal in binary to R2 and then stores the value in R2. So the Register R2 will contain the decimal value of 12 at the end of the program.

QUESTION 2.  Explain in a few sentences why the ability to step through a program (run one instruction at a time) is a very useful tool for debugging a program. Debugging is the process of finding and correcting bugs (or errors) in a program. Hint: Finding a bug is often much more difficult than correcting it.

ANSWER: It is useful because you can compare each step's output to the expected at that stage and find the bug which is causing the incorrect output. It helps for programmers to find the problem in the program systematically.
