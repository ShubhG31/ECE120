;This program accesses a memory array with specific numbers.
;The program adds the total positive numbers in the memory array.
;The program does not add any negative numbers
;By the end of the program only the sum of the positive numbers remain in the register.

; R3: Hold the location address of the number 
; R4: will hold the counter value
; R5: holds the value of the total sum of the positive numbers

; R2: Takes the value in the address in R3

0011 0001 0000 0000 ; x3100 - starting address of the program

; The program description and code starts here

;Part 1 where registers are intialized 

1110 011 000110001    ; Address x3132 is stored in R3, since numbers start from this value
0101 101 011 1 00000  ; Initialize R5 to value 0
0001 100 101 1 01010  ; Initialize R4 to value 10 

;Part 2 where the arithmetic can be done by using the loop

0110 010 011 000000   ; Moving Memory content(number) of address in R3 to R2

0000 100 000000001    ; If(negative number) the next line of code is skipped
0001 101 101 000 010  ; If(positive number) R5=R2+R5
0001 011 011 1 00001  ; The pointer is incremented by 1, R3=R3+1
0001 100 100 1 11111  ; The counter is decremented by 1, R4=R4-1
0000 001 111111010    ; If (Counter>0) go back to x3103 

1111 0000 0010 0101   ; The program is halted by using vector x25
